# tests/reports
Validation outputs: plots, screenshots, and media from milestone runs (temperature control, safety, leak, flow).

- `tests/scripts/m2_logger_plot.py` writes PNGs here using the CSV stem.
- Name artifacts by milestone/task (ex: `m2_closedloop.png`, `m3_fault_demo.mp4`) and mention the source CSV or hardware setup in the report/PR.
