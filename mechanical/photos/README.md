# mechanical/photos
Assembly and testbed photos (wiring, leak tests, waterproofing, mounts).

- Name files by milestone/task (ex: `m2_servo_mount.jpg`, `m3_estop_wiring.jpg`).
- Add a brief caption in a `.md` or `_notes.txt` if the photo shows something non-obvious (orientation, clearances, torque notes).
