# mechanical/cad
Fusion 360 models for mounts, enclosure pieces, and printable hardware.

## Layout
- `servo_mount/` — bracket to hold the MG996R servo at the valve.
- `valve_coupler/` — coupler between servo horn and valve stem.
- `exports/` — STL exports for printing (name by milestone/task).

Add new variants with a short note on fitment/tolerances; keep param edits in the CAD source and export fresh STLs when dimensions change.
